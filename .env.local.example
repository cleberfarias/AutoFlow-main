# Example local environment variables for development
# Set the ChatGuru backend base URL used by the Vite dev proxy (see vite.config.ts)
VITE_CHATGURU_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000

# NOTES:
# - Do NOT put production secrets (OpenAI/Gemini keys, ChatGuru API keys) in frontend .env files.
# - Server-only env vars should be configured on the server: OPENAI_API_KEY, CHATGURU_BASE_URL, CHATGURU_API_KEY, etc.
# - This file is an example only; copy to `.env.local` if you want to run locally and adjust values as needed.
